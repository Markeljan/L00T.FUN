## 🎯 What We Built

### Four Instant Games

1. **🎁 Loot Drop Multiplier** - Crack open glowing chests for multipliers from 0.1x to 100x
2. **🎯 Orbital Lock** - Time the rotating pointer perfectly to climb the multiplier ladder
3. **📈 Base Pulse** - Ride live token price movements for 20 seconds, sell anytime
4. **🏰 Dungeon Gauntlet** - Navigate through levels, choosing doors to escape with multipliers

### Key Features

    // Calculate payout with house edge
    // Instant settlement
}
```
